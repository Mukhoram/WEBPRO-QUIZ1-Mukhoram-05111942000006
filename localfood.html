              <p class="bk"><br>  This food has its own philosophy to its name, 
                  and its because of its shape resembling kemojo or frangipani flowers.
                   The texture of kemojo sponge tends to be solid like a wet cake and dominated by sweetness. 
                   Kemojo bowls are brownish with the greenish color. 
                   This green color is produced by a mixture of water from suji leaves and pandan leaves. 
                   In addition to the beautiful color and shape, the aroma of pandanus from sponge cake is also appetizing.</p>
